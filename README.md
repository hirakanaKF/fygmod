# Explanation of Changes #

Changes of `define/battle.js`:
  * Defense damage multiplier is now `(AttackBase + DefendBase * exp(-DefenseRatio * EffectBase)) / (DefenseBase + DefendBase * exp(-AttackRatio * EffectBase))`
    * In which `DefendBase = 65536.0`.
  * Serveral effect of skill changes to fit the custom formula:
    * Auras:
      * SHENG: Doubles effect of defense multiplier for shield.
      * RE: Increase 6 points of speed ratio instead of 9 after battling.
      * ZHI: Halves effect of defense multiplier.
      * HONG: When attacking, calculates damage using the higher multiplier.
      * JUE: 0.75x damage taken from physical / magical damage, 0.5x damage taken from absolute damage.
      * DUNH: Calculates the damage multiplier using `1 + tanh()` instead of `exp()`.
  * For more details, please refers to `define/battle.js`.

Changes of `config/emu.json.js`:
* `Rule` changes:
  * `UseNumbers`: 0 -> 1
    * Disables integer cast simulation globally.
  * `NoOverkill`: 0 -> 1

    * This is the global damage, healing, resistant scale factor.
  * `EffectBase`: 0.0 -> 5.4152123481245725e-3 ( â‰ˆ log(2) / 128 )
    * Enables ratio transforms:
      * Healing, Leeching, Reflection: `x * 0.01` -> `1 - exp(-x * EffectBase)`
      * Others : `x * 0.01` -> `exp(x * EffectBase)`
    * For more details, please see `fygemu/define/config.js`.
  * `SklAdd` : 99 -> 1024
  * `CrtAdd` : 99 -> 1024

   * In this demo, we show you how to customize asset path.
   * This demo use custom assets, which were processed from __[game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net/)__.
